# SQLAlchemy Migration Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Setup
- Created `database.py` with dual database support (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Implemented automatic Railway PostgreSQL detection
- Set up SQLAlchemy with Flask-SQLAlchemy integration

### 2. Models Created
All 7 models have been created with SQLAlchemy ORM:
- **Budget**: Financial tracking with computed properties (remaining, progress_percentage)
- **Family**: Family approval tracking
- **Travel**: Travel arrangements and bookings
- **Itinerary**: Daily activities with proposal flag
- **Packing**: Packing list items
- **Ring**: Ring details with balance calculation
- **File**: File upload management
- **User**: Authentication model with password hashing

### 3. Data Migration
- Successfully backed up original JSON data
- Migrated all data from `hera_data.json` to SQLAlchemy database
- Migration statistics:
  - 8 Budget items
  - 7 Family members
  - 6 Travel arrangements
  - 41 Itinerary items
  - 7 Packing items
  - 1 Ring detail
  - 15 Files

### 4. Flask App Integration
- Updated `app.py` to use SQLAlchemy models
- Replaced all HERA_DATA dictionary references with database queries
- Maintained all API endpoints for backward compatibility
- Added full CRUD operations for all models

### 5. Production Deployment Setup
- Created `Procfile` for Railway deployment with gunicorn
- Added `railway.json` configuration
- Updated `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- Created `.env.example` for environment variables
- Configured automatic PostgreSQL detection for Railway

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `database.py` - Database configuration
- `models.py` - All SQLAlchemy models
- `init_db.py` - Database initialization script
- `utils/migration.py` - JSON to SQLAlchemy migration tool
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `verify_migration.py` - Migration verification script

### Modified Files
- `app.py` - Complete SQLAlchemy integration
- `requirements.txt` - Added SQLAlchemy dependencies
- `Procfile` - Updated for gunicorn
- `.railwayignore` - Already configured

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python init_db.py

# Run migration (if needed)
python utils/migration.py

# Start application
python app.py
```

### Railway Deployment
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to GitHub repository
3. Railway will auto-detect PostgreSQL need
4. Set environment variables in Railway:
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a strong secret key
   - `ADMIN_USERNAME`: Set admin username
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Set secure password
5. Deploy will use PostgreSQL automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Template Issues

Some templates still have references that need fixing:
1. `dashboard.html` line 161: Change `item.budget` to `item.amount`
2. Templates using `.get()` on SQLAlchemy objects need updating
3. Templates passing SQLAlchemy objects to `tojson` need `.to_dict()` calls

## üîê Default Credentials
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
**Important**: Change these in production!

## üìä Database Configuration
- Development: SQLite (`hera.db`)
- Production: PostgreSQL (auto-configured by Railway)

## ‚úÖ Migration Verified
- All data successfully migrated from JSON
- Computed properties working correctly
- Database relationships established
- CRUD operations functional

## üéâ Migration Complete!
The HERA Dashboard has been successfully migrated from JSON storage to SQLAlchemy ORM with full database support.
